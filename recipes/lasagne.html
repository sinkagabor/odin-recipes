    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a
        busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>300g pack fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches
            for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is
            browned all over.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated
            nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins stirring
            occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t
            see any pasta poking through.</li>
    </ol>
